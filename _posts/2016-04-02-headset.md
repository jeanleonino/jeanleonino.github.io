Nowadays my workstation is running Ubuntu, and I use a USB headset to deal with 
calls and also isolate me when I'm coding. 

One thing that annoyed me for a long while is that when I connect the headset 
Ubuntu does not pick it automatically. 

I decided to finally change this, scrolled through lots of questions and 
solutions on Ubuntu/StackOverflow and [this one][ubuntu-solution] worked:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo echo "load-module module-switch-on-connect" >> /etc/pulse/default.pa
{% endhighlight %}

The magic underneath: You are activating [module-switch-on-connect][pulseaudio-doc]
that, according to the documentation, whenever a new sink or source appears, 
this module will switch the default sink/source to be the new sink/source, 
and will move all currently running streams to the new sink/source.

**Disclaimer** it may behave weirdly in some cases, for example, when the Sound 
Settings window is open.
